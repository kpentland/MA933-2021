# Notebooks for MA933 Stochastic Modelling and Random Processes (2021-22)

The module webpage can be found [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/courses/msc/ma933/).

Lecturer: [Susana Gomes](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/gomes/) 

Teaching Assistant: [Kamran Pentland](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/people/students/2019intake/pentland/)

## Getting started
* Simply download (or clone) the repository to your laptop. 
* Create a separate folder on your laptop to store your own notebooks. 

Notebooks will be uploaded before each support class. If something is not working, get in contact with me. 

## Contents of each notebook

`Support Class 1.ipynb`
* basic linear algebra in python
* simple random walk animation 
* function SRW, a simple random walk with arguements p (probability steping up), tmax (when to terminate the walk) and N (number of replications)
* empirical distribution calculated at a fixed time (hist plot over possible states at time n)
* simulation with periodic boundary conditions (modulus L (L =10))
* simulation with closed boundary conditions (reflects at 10 and 0)


## Other helpful informtion
This will be updated as the module progresses. 

### LaTeX
It's recommended you use Overleaf (particularly useful for group projects as multiple people can work on the same document at the same time). You can sign up with your Warwick details (and you should have access to premium features): [https://www.overleaf.com/](https://www.overleaf.com/)
